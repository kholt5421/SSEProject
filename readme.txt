The "Spoof Call and Malware Simulator(SCAMS)" system is a game developed by Florida Polytechnic University students Robert Grant, Katelyn Holt, Matthew Rigg, Megan Ruiz, and Emil Torres for the CEN4033 Secure Software Engineering Section 2 course. SCAMS is an educational game designed to teach players about five different attacks and threats that their mobile device is vulnerable to. The game has five levels, each dedicated to an attack or threat. As the player progresses through each level, they accumulate points based on how well they did. If the player is proud of their score, they can create an account and save that score to their account. The top 10 scores are placed on a leaderboard, along with their usernames, as "Certified Security Geniuses". 

As of right now, SCAMS is unable to operate on the web. As such, if you want to play SCAMS, some setup will be required. 
You will need compilers for or an IDE that supports the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJS. 
Once you have that, use your computer's command prompt or your IDE's terminal to navigate to you are storing the SCAMS game. 
Once there, run the following command: node Server/server.js
If you see the message "Server listening on http://localhost:3000", it means the game is successfully running on your local host port 3000.
Once you have done this, open up your browser and go to "localhost3000:/", or click the link in the message.
This should take you to the menu screen for SCAMS. Once there, you can play the game as you wish.
When you want to close the game, close the tab with the game and then close your terminal or command prompt. This causes the program to cease running on port 3000.

Note: SCAMS was tested in Windows 10 and 11 environments. Results on other operating systems may vary.
